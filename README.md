🔬 The Revolution of Smart Microscopy and Data driven Event loops
Data-driven approaches, integrating machine learning (ML) and adaptive feedback, are fundamentally reshaping fluorescence and brightfield microscopy for pathology and live-cell imaging.

Smart microscopes enhance image acquisition through techniques like content-aware illumination, ML-based denoising, and adaptive optics. Crucially, they dynamically control imaging parameters—such as focus, field of view, and frame rate—in real-time response to the sample.

This capability allows for real-time decision-making. For instance, event-driven microscopy can automatically capture fleeting biological events by instantly adjusting imaging speed. AI-guided pathology microscopes intelligently scan slides by prioritizing and focusing on relevant tumor regions.

Hence we try to make the microscope smarter, by bringing AI to the microscope:
